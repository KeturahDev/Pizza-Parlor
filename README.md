By Keturah Howard, January 31st 2020.

## Description
  
Enjoy the similation of getting to order a pizza and see the cost at my fake pizzaria! choose a size, any toppings you desire that are available to be chosen, and get the luxery of receiving the price thhat you would have to pay, but dont! Because its not real! ahhh, the sweet feeling of saving money while also getting to costomize something. Have fun, but not too much fun!
*This is an Epicodus friday project designed with the purpose of testing my ability and understand of js constructors and prototypes.*

## Behavioral Driven Development
  *Heres a list of the specific behaviors I wanted to be acheived throughout the development process, starting from most basic to complex.*

* user can click order button
  * input: click order button
  * output: 'order received'
* user can select size for pizza
  * input: choose which size of pizza, click done
  * output: 'pizza size: *size of pizza*' in console
* user can select a topping for pizza
  * input: choose which size of pizza, then topping, click done
  * output: 'pizza topping: *topping*' in console
* user can select multiple toppings for pizza
  * input: choose which size of pizza, then toppings, click done
  * output: 'pizza toppings: *toppings*' in console
* user sees their order displayed when they click done
  * input: chooses stuff
  * output: display 'your pizza is *pizza size* sized with *toppings listed out* toppings'
* total is displayed as well 
  * input: clicks done
  * output: display total after 'your pizza is *pizza size* sized with *toppings listed out* toppings'
* total accounts for 'extra' on toppings
  * input: selects extra cheese
  * output: price + 0.25
